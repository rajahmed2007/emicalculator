## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development (used via CDN).
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For all calculations, interactivity, and DOM manipulation.
* **Google Fonts (Inter):** For clean and readable typography.

## üí° How it Works

The calculator uses the standard EMI formula:

$$
EMI = P \times r \times \frac{(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
$$
Where:
* **P** = Principal Loan Amount (Loan Amount - Down Payment)
* **r** = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
* **n** = Loan Tenure in Months (Tenure in Years * 12)

It then iteratively calculates the interest and principal paid for each month to generate the amortization schedule.
